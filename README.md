Controlling Android Devices for Call Recording with Raspberry Pi


The Repository describes how to set up an environment using a Raspberry Pi to repeatedly make calls to an Android device and record audio for assessing voice quality. 
It outlines the process of initiating calls using ADB commands, which may not be supported by all models, and starting recording upon detecting ringback tones with a script. 

The guide includes steps for Raspberry Pi setup, verifying USB audio adapter functionality, using Python for operations, and backing up the SD card.
